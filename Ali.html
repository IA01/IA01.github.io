<p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Clay, is regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time. He had immense confidence in his abilities and never backed away from taking blows. His fight with George Foreman has been called "arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century" 
</p>
<p>His legacy though goes beyond his in ring expolits. He stood up for African-American rights. He stood up for humanitarian rights by refusing to take part in The Vietnam War. This decision cost him his peak years in his career where he was banned and stripped off his titles. But there was more to Ali than just records and titles. He used the platform he got through being boxer, to propagate the idea of being a better human.

<p>Ali was uninhibited and brutal with his thoughts. He spoke his mind. He also never shied away from proclaiming himself as the greatest. He knew he was. He will always be regarded as someone who was ruthless inside the ring, but a true icon outside it who stood up for millions of people and inspired generations to come.</p>
