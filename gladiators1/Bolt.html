	<p>Usain Bolt, also known as 'Lightning Bolt' is regarded as the fastest man on the planet. He has multiple records in the 100m and 200m sprints at Olympics as well as World Championships.His skill lied in his acceleration, not his starts. He was never amongst the best starters which just highlights one thing; his immense belief in himself till the last millisecond.</p>
	<p> Bolt is revered not just for his unbelievable records but also for helping in the resurgence of the sport. Bolt arrived when athletics was marred by doping scandals;six of the fastest men after Bolt have been caught in doping related scandals at some point. Bolt emerged as a clean champion and showed the world the power of pure hardwork and dedication.</p>

<p>Usain Bolt arrived as a knight in shining armour. Not only did he break record after record, he helped athletics recapture the World's imagination. His cool, nonchalant and extremely confident mannerisms before all important races were a sight to behold. His sheer domination at the highest stages will be talked about for generations to come.</p>
