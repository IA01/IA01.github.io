	<p>Usain Bolt, also known as 'Lightning Bolt' is regarded as the fastest man on the planet. He has multiple records in the 100m and 200m sprints at Olympics as well as World Championships.His skill lied in his acceleration, not his starts. He was never amongst the best starters which just highlights one thing; his immense belief in himself till the last milisecond.</p>
	<p> Bolt is revered not just for his unbelievable records but also for helping in the resurgence of the sport. Bolt arrived when athletics was marred by doping scandals;six of the fastest men after Bolt have been caught in doping related scandals at some point. Bolt emerged as a clean champion and showed the worl the power of pure hardwork and dedication.</p>
